üöÄ Tech Stack & Deployment

This project leverages a simple and effective stack for performance and maintainability.

    Front-End:

        HTML5: For the core structure and content.

        Tailwind CSS: For a utility-first, modern styling workflow.

        JavaScript: For interactive elements like the mobile navigation menu.

    Version Control:

        Git & GitHub: For source code management and version control.

    Deployment:

        The site is hosted on Netlify.

        Continuous Deployment is enabled, meaning any push to the main branch on GitHub automatically triggers a new live build.
